This code is a simulation of a 3-link spatial robot using the PyBullet physics engine. The simulation is rendered in a GUI and controlled by the user.

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries including PyBullet, Numpy, and Matplotlib. PyBullet is used for physics simulation, Numpy is used for numerical calculations and manipulations, and Matplotlib is used for creating plots.

First, the code connects to the PyBullet server using the p.GUI function. Next, the URDF of the robot is loaded. The number of joints in the robot is then printed, and the initial joint positions are set.

The code then defines a function "change" which takes an array as input, increases the value of each element in the array by 0.01, and returns the modified array. A function "go" which takes an array as input, calls the change function with that array, sets the joint positions of the robot with the returned array, and returns the modified array.

The code then runs the simulation for 5000 timesteps, where in each timestep the function go is called with the current joint positions, the simulation is stepped, and the program waits for 1/240 of a second.

Finally, the code disconnects from the PyBullet server, and the simulation ends.
