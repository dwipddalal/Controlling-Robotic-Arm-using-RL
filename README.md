## Building simuation environement

- We used pybullet to build the pysics based simulation environment that can be embedded with physics. 

PyBullet is a physics engine that can be used for simulating rigid-body dynamics with contacts and is widely used in robotics and machine learning research. It is written in C++ but it provides a Python API which allows it to be used with Python.

The PyBullet Python API can be used to create, simulate and control physics in a PyBullet simulation. It provides functions for creating and manipulating objects, applying forces and torques, and retrieving information about the simulation state. You can also use PyBullet's Python API to connect to other Python libraries such as OpenAI's Gym, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to perform reinforcement learning tasks.

In summary, PyBullet is a powerful physics engine that can be used to simulate robotic arms and other multi-body systems, and its Python API allows it to be easily integrated with Python-based machine learning libraries.


## Some experiments that we ran to check for robustness of pybullet environment

## Documentation Sytle

We have used PEP 8 format style in this case.
