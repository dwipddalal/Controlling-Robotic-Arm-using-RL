This code contains two functions forward_kinematics and inverse_kinematics, which are used to calculate the forward and inverse kinematics of a 2-link planar robot, respectively.


forward_kinematics(theta1, theta2, l1, l2)
This function takes four inputs:

theta1: the angle of the first link with respect to the x-axis.
theta2: the angle of the second link with respect to the first link.
l1: the length of the first link.
l2: the length of the second link.
It returns a list containing the x and y coordinates of the end-effector of the robot.

inverse_kinematics(x, y, l1, l2, branch=1)
This function takes four inputs:

x: the x-coordinate of the end-effector of the robot.
y: the y-coordinate of the end-effector of the robot.
l1: the length of the first link.
l2: the length of the second link.
branch: an optional parameter (default value is 1) that selects the branch of the inverse kinematics solution to use.
It returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating if the position is within the robot's workspace and a list containing the angles of the first and second links.

The remaining code in the file uses the PyBullet library to connect to a physics simulation, loads a plane and robot, sets the gravity and time step, and runs a simulation to move the robot to a desired position by controlling the torque of the joints. It then compares the actual position of the end-effector to the desired position.
